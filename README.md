# Covid-19 NYC Real Estate Research
This project was developed as part of a class. 
The goal was to develop a project analyzing  the impact that COVID-19 has had on the people and economy of NYC. Specifically, to record the impact it had on the residents of the 5 boroughs, we will be recording the number of cases that occurred in NYC.
